            This is Vespa! My beloved dachshund. This picture was taken recently when we went for a walk to a park near our home. She is almost 11 years old. She loves running on the grass and occassionally rolling on bugs and worms in the grass. Her favorite treat is chicken jerky from Costco.
            She doesn't have that many teeth left so she cannot chew on her chew-treats like beef-tendon or bully sticks anymore. Anyhow, she prefers cuddling with people more than she enjoys chews and alone-time so it isn't so bad. When you first meet Vespa, she would seem as though she would tear you to pieces.
            But, really she is the sweetest heart once she spends some time with you and gets to know you. You would melt for this wonderful little doggy with the biggest heart in the world.

                This is Julian. He is a sly little lemur. He annointed himself the king of Madagascar. He has many friends and a huge family. He has so many cousins that he's lost count.
                This is a picture of him right before lunch time. He was curious to see what the caregivers had prepared for him. He had requested some nuts on a silver platter that day.

                This is Steven Tylor. Oh boy he loves to sing. Some would say that he doesn't have the sweetest voice in the world, but that didn't stop him from becoming a rock-legend. 
                Really, he's amazing. His favorite song to sing to the ladies is called Crazy. It goes like this: "Say you're leaving on a seven thrity train and that you're heading out to Hollywood.
                Girl, you been givin me that line so many times it kinda gets like feeling bad looks good, yeah." And it goes on...

                Alex the lion! He's an aspiring model. His passion is to entertain visitors. Oh, he's got moves. You must come see his show for yourself to believe it. He won't dissapoint you. 
                Come cheer this kid. He'll melt your heart like a stick of butter left out in the sun. His favorite food is steak of course with a side of baked Yukon Gold potatoes, but just keep the veggies 
                for the monkeys and the bunnies. He's definitely a meat and potato guy, yet he's able to keep that body lean and mean. And, as you can see, there's no question that he's got the best hair around here.

                Meet George. Everybody calls him Uncle George. He's the oldest resident around here. Oh no, he's not sad in this picture. He's just trying to come up with ideas
                for his website. He's just started dabbling in web-development recently. Although, the front-end side has been mostly a fruitful learning process, the backend part is kicking his butt.
                It is hard! He doesn't know if he should drop the class or just roll with it. He doesn't have to get an A in every class, although he would love to because he's a perfectionist.
                He doesn't like leaving things unfinished or unsolved. He wishes that he completed Colt Steele's Udemy course before taking this web-development class. Now, he needs some quiet time to think.

                Meet tiger-mom Lucy and tiger-baby Franklin junior. Lucy is nothing like the other tiger-moms. She's so chilled. Everybody loves her around here. She the best caregiver to Franklin and also 
                to her other children that have grown up. Franklin is the brightest and sharpest little boy. He's so kind to his playmates. He would make the best big-brother. Momma Lucy 
                is so proud of her son. She always praises Franklin for being momma's little helper. Momma Lucy doesn't get why the other moms are so fussy about what their children do. 
                The sweetest tiger mommy and bady duo around here.
